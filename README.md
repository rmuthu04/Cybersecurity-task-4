# Task 4 â€” Firewall Configuration (Windows)

## ðŸ”° Objective
Configure and test basic firewall rules on Windows to understand how firewall controls network traffic.

## ðŸ›  Steps Performed

### 1) Opened Windows Firewall Advanced Settings
- Searched "Windows Defender Firewall"
- Clicked **Advanced settings** to open the management console

### 2) Viewed Existing Inbound Rules
- Navigated to **Inbound Rules**

### 3) Created Rule to Block Port 23 (Telnet)
- Clicked **New Rule â†’ Port**
- Selected **TCP** and entered port `23`
- Chose **Block the connection**

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts Learned

### What is a firewall?
A firewall is a security system that monitors and filters network traffic based on rules to protect systems from unauthorized access.

### Why Block Port 23 (Telnet)?
- Telnet is unencrypted and transmits credentials in plaintext
- Hackers often exploit it for remote access
- SSH (port 22) is recommended instead

### Inbound vs Outbound Rules
- **Inbound Rules**: Control traffic coming **into** the device
- **Outbound Rules**: Control traffic **leaving** the device

## âœ… Outcome
Successfully created, tested, and removed firewall rule â€” demonstrating understanding of:
- Traffic filtering
- Ports and protocol control
- Basic security hardening using firewall rules
